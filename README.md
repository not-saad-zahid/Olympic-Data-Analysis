# Olympic Data Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Olympic Games data using Jupyter Notebook and Python. By exploring historical datasets, it uncovers trends, patterns, and insights related to athletes, countries, and events across different Olympic years.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Processes raw Olympic datasets for accurate analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes trends in medal counts, athlete participation, gender representation, and more.
- **Country & Athlete Insights:** Compares performance across nations and highlights standout athletes.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Uses plots and charts to make findings accessible and engaging.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Each analysis is documented and reproducible, allowing for easy understanding and further exploration.

## Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook** - For interactive data analysis and visualization
- **Python** - Data processing and analysis
- **Pandas, NumPy** - Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** - Data visualization
